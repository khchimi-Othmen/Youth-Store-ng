# Online_Store(Angular)

This repository contains an Angular project that implements the MVVM pattern and uses a Template-Driven approach. The project also uses Material Design and includes both front-end and back-office components. The shopping cart scenario has been implemented and is working well.

## MVVM Pattern

The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern is used to separate the user interface (View) from the business logic and data (Model) by using a ViewModel as an intermediary layer. This makes it easier to maintain and test the application as changes in the View or Model do not affect each other directly.

## Template-Driven Approach

In this project, we have used the Template-Driven approach for creating forms in Angular. This approach allows us to define forms using HTML templates and provides built-in validation and error handling.

## Material Design

We have used some Material Design components in this project to create a consistent and modern look and feel for the user interface. Material Design provides a set of pre-built components that are easy to use and customize.

## Front-Office and Back-Office

This project includes both front-Office and back-office components. The front-Office is the customer-facing part of the application, where customers can browse products and make purchases. The back-office is the admin-facing part of the application, where administrators can manage products, orders, and customers.

## Shopping Cart Scenario

The shopping cart scenario has been implemented in this project and is working well. Customers can add products to their cart, update the quantity of products, and remove products from the cart. The total price is calculated automatically based on the products in the cart.
